# EverydayDataScience

<strong><u>Overview</u></strong>:
I am challenging myself for dedicating atleast couple of hours everyday towards either learning(revisiting) some cool concepts of DataScience(collection of tools that turn data into real-world actions.) , solving some problems available on Kaggle etc. I am currently targeting for atleast 'no-break' 100 days.
I will request the same from you.


<strong><u>Why Everyday?</strong></u>

<strong>Data Science is awesome:</strong>
It is an exciting, fast-moving field to become involved in.Much of the value that a data scientist brings to the table is clarity and insights from the vast quantities of data .It is all about understanding the true potential of Data in your hand.Also we can solve lots of real world problems like : fraud detection,drugs for major diseases(skin cancer),improving the education system etc.

If you are still not convinced to dedicate few hours of your day in becoming 'A master' of this transformative technology,let me talk about some of the personal benefits:
Going for something you love daily will make a solid habit and consequently will add a touch of discipline in your life.
You will have strong online presence (as we also need to share our work,so that it can benefit others)
Getting feedback on your work constantly , so that you can understand you are on the right track.




<strong><u>Are you eligible?</strong></u>

Always wanted to make an entry into the fascinating world of Data Science,wait no more, start small -> learn it -> share it -> get feedback -> improve(and repeat)
Already an established data scientist , share your amazing work , help others , get feedback and improve further(as they say: there is always room for improvement)
So,Everyone is eligible who are in love with this coolest technology of our time.




<strong><u>Are there any rules?</u></strong>

There are no rules, just some promises to be kept :

let's pledge together to dedicate at least couple of hours everyday towards either learning(revisiting) some cool concepts of DataScience(collection of tools that turn data into real-world actions.) and sharing them via your favorite social platform using the #EverydayDataScience Hashtag.

Encourage your fellow learners via a 'like', 'share', or comment! if you see a post using the #EverydayDataScience hashtag.
